Denovo is a 2012 Ranger Tug R29 Classic. We purchased her from previous owners in September 2019, upgrading from a Cal-27 sailboat. She was a perfect fit for our family's introduction into powerboating around the Puget Sound, up to the San Juans, and through the Ballard locks into Lake Washington. Having succumbed to ten-foot-itis, though, we're now upsizing to a larger boat.

As hyperattentive owners, we've kept her in tip-top shape, installed a few extras, and performed all regular service on schedule. She's truly turnkey and ready for new owners!
