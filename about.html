Hey there, I’m Jared. By day, I’m a professional nerd using mysteriously fantastic engineering skills to finance sadly expensive hobbies. Sometimes I lead teams of other nerds, and sometimes I nerd-out on my own. Currently, I'm a Director of Software Engineering at [ForgeRock](https://www.forgerock.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I have a wonderful wife, a beautiful daughter, and three crazy cats. All have the uncanny ability to melt my heart and try my patience at the same time.

Over the past few years, I've been transitioning my main hobby from technical rebreather diving to boating. Tech diving and underwater photography conditioned me to spending tons of money on dumb things, so I was prepped for boating. And boating is WAY more family-friendly than diving the deep, dark, murky waters of Puget Sound. You can check out some of those adventures at [pacificnorthwestdiving.com](https://www.pacificnorthwestdiving.com){:target="_blank"}.

We're currently on our third boat, a 1988 Ocean Alexander 420 Sundeck named "Rendezvous", and can be found cruising Puget Sound regularly year-round. If you boat in the Pacific Northwest, and especially if you have pre-teen kids, we should connect!
